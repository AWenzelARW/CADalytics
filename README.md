# CADalytics Creator Factory - Railway Deployment (FIXED)

## ðŸ”§ Build Issue Fixed

The esbuild error has been resolved by:
- Using `npx esbuild` instead of direct `esbuild` command
- Installing all dependencies (including dev) during Docker build
- Ensuring esbuild is available in the build environment

## Quick Deploy to Railway

1. **Upload this tarball to Railway**
2. **Set build command**: `node build.js`
3. **Set start command**: `node dist/index.js`
4. **Deploy** - Should now work without errors!

## What's Fixed

- âœ… **esbuild command**: Now uses `npx esbuild` to ensure availability
- âœ… **Docker dependencies**: Installs dev dependencies needed for build
- âœ… **Build process**: Successfully creates `dist/index.js` (7.9kb)
- âœ… **Production ready**: Includes all necessary files for Railway

## Files Included

- `server/` - Express.js backend source code
- `shared/` - Shared TypeScript schemas
- `dist/` - Pre-built static files (includes working HTML app)
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- `build.js` - **FIXED** custom build script
- `Dockerfile` - **UPDATED** container configuration

## Environment Variables

Railway will automatically set:
- `PORT` - Application port
- `NODE_ENV=production` - Production mode

Optional (set if needed):
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string

## Build Process (Now Working)

The fixed `build.js` script:
1. âœ… Uses `npx esbuild` for reliable builds
2. âœ… Bundles TypeScript server to `dist/index.js`
3. âœ… Prepares static files in `dist/public/`
4. âœ… Creates production `package.json`
5. âœ… Ready for Railway deployment

## Expected Output
